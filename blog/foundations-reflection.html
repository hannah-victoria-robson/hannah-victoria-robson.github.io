            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? 
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li><p>I hate having to interpret questions and instructions because I don’t want to do things the wrong way.</p> </li>
            <li><p> have more of a fixed mindset and need to work to make it growth mindset</p> </li>
            <li><p>I find listening and looping exercises very difficult, as I feel put on the spot and am worried I won’t be able to remember what the other person said</p></li>
          </ul>
          <h2>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Values: who you are and what you bring shapes your journey. It's also important to understand what every person is bringing</p></li>
            <li><p>Empathy: this is what enables us to feel, see, understand the world from other people's perspectives. This helps us to Identify others' problems and create solutions. It also aids in communication and helps us to write code with the intention of it being readable for anyone who may have to work on it in the future</p></li>
            <li><p>Self-awareness: awareness of your true skills, interests, and characteristics which act as your foundation for your journey</p></li>

          <h2>
            What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
          </h2>
          <p>
            How challenging I find it to have to write the blogs and answer these sorts of questions
          </p>
          <h2>
            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Having to answer these kinds of questions because there is no clear correct or incorrect answer, and they require me to interpret the question. 
          </p>
          <h2>
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I feel this has already been explained many times. It is because core learning is crucial to working well in any job and getting the most out of learning. They are also the skills that many are looking for in programmers 
          </p>
          <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.                
          </h2>
          <p>
            No, because of the emphasis put on how beneficial it will be for our future careers.
