          End of Foundations: Learning plan reflection

        <h2>
          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway
        </h2>
        <p>
          I view the world as dynamic. I don’t understand the purpose of long-term goals as the person I will be when the next stage arrives will be different from who I am at the time of setting goals. I plan my life in steps and directions. The current step must be finished in order for the next step to be decided. I will learn about programming and myself each day of the course, so it’s impossible to predict what my interests and strengths will be at the end. I want to have a well-paying job that I find interesting, security, flexibility of location and WFH options - the specifics will reveal themselves along my career path. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p>
          They are mostly the same but I would add that I struggle to communicate effectively regarding technical matters and find it very difficult to engage with videos and video calls. <br>
          I think the struggle with videos and video calls will be a problem during bootcamp. I have purchased some fidget toys in the hopes they might help.
        </p>
        <h2>
          What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Keeping on top of my self-care/wellbeing. I have been feeling unwell for a long time and have a lot of anxiety around long-covid (therefore covid in general). This has all added to my self-care falling apart. Sleep schedule, exercise, diet, etc have all been things I am struggling with. I don’t feel comfortable going to the gym, nor seeing my family based in Christchurch (as my step-brother is working in person at a theatre). I also don't have a strong support system, even with my family. Thankfully I have amazing flatmates and they have a cute cat who helps a lot with moral, but I’m not going into bootcamp in an ideal situation, with great health, and great habits. I am quite worried about how I will manage that side of things. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Skills to help me thrive in a professional environment, such as: communication, hard conversations, leadership skills, confidence, speaking in front of others, giving and receiving feedback, working in teams.  
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Support for me looks like reassurance that I am doing well enough, answering questions when I find the instructions or resources to be too ambiguous and require interpretation, helping me to see my strengths/what I've done well, and helping me to understand where I can improve and what resources will help me to do so. 
        </p>
        <h2>
          What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I will use pomodoro timers to manage and track my time. If I spent 20min trying to solve a problem with no success, I will reach out for help. <br>
          I will do my best to put my ego aside and be honest about the things I am struggling with. <br>
          I will do my best to look after my emotional, physical, and psychological wellbeing, reach out to the appropriate people if I am struggling to do so, and take action to find support needed.

        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1> </div><br> <br>
        <div class="glassbg">
      <div class="main-text">
        <h2> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h2> 
        <p>Become a developer. Work in a technical role. Have a job I enjoy with a decent salary and flexibility for location and WFH options. </p>
      <br> <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
       <p>Strengths: understanding abstract ideas, creative problem solving, empathy, I enjoy helping others, enjoy finding solutions, curious, </p>
<p>Limitations: Aim too high, have complex ideas, time management, prioritisation, focus (can be unfocused or hyper-focused), can lose time trying to solve problems or find better ways to do things without thinking to ask for help.</p>
<br><h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>Working with others, time management, prioritisation, communicating professionally, confidence in my work, strategies to feel less anxious. </p>
<br><h2>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
<p>Scheduling my study time, using pomodoro timers to manage how much time I am spending on each task, open communication, asking for support/help when needed. </p>
<br><h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
<p>Speak to others, reach out for help, take a break/step back, make sure I'm eating/sleeping/ moving enough, try to identify and list my emotions, try to identify and list the causes, try to think of one thing I can do to improve each cause. </p>
<br><h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
<p>My facilitator Sophia gave me great advice for this. She said if I have spent 20min trying to figure something out without success, I should ask for help. </p>
 
 
<br><h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
<p>Guidance, understanding, feedback, suggestions for how I can improve. </p>
<br><h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
<p>I plan to study between the following blocks of time. I will update as needed.</p>
