      <div class="main-text">
        <h2> What is your long term goal and/or career pathway? </h2> 
        <p>Become a developer. Work in a technical role. Have a job I enjoy with a decent salary and flexibility for location and WFH options. </p>
      <br> <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>
       <p>Strengths: understanding abstract ideas, creative problem solving, empathy, I enjoy helping others, enjoy finding solutions, curious, </p>
<p>Limitations: Aim too high, have complex ideas, time management, prioritisation, focus (can be unfocused or hyper-focused), can lose time trying to solve problems or find better ways to do things without thinking to ask for help.</p>
<br><h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>Working with others, time management, prioritisation, communicating professionally, confidence in my work, strategies to feel less anxious. </p>
<br><h2>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
<p>Scheduling my study time, using pomodoro timers to manage how much time I am spending on each task, open communication, asking for support/help when needed. </p>
<br><h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
<p>Speak to others, reach out for help, take a break/step back, make sure I'm eating/sleeping/ moving enough, try to identify and list my emotions, try to identify and list the causes, try to think of one thing I can do to improve each cause. </p>
<br><h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
<p>My facilitator Sophia gave me great advice for this. She said if I have spent 20min trying to figure something out without success, I should ask for help. </p>
 
 
<br><h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
<p>Guidance, understanding, feedback, suggestions for how I can improve. </p>
<br><h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
<p>I plan to study between the following blocks of time. I will update as needed.</p>
