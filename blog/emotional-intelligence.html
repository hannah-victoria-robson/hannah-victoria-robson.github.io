<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?
</h2>
<div class="glassbg">
<p>
  EI is the ability to recognize, manage, and understand emotions. Both your own, and those of others. 
Some researchers suggest that there are four levels of emotional intelligence, based on difficulty: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Step one: Perceiving emotions <br>
    <h4>The ability to perceive emotions accurately. </h4></li> <br>
  <li>Step two: Reasoning with emotions <br>
    <h4>Using emotions to promote thinking and help prioritise what we pay attention to.
    </h4></li> <br>
  <li>Step three: Understanding emotions <br>
    <h4> ability to interpret the cause and meaning of the emotion being expressed. 
    </h4></li> <br>
  <li>Step Four: Managing emotions <br>
   <h4> The ability to regulate emotions, respond appropriately, and respond to the emotions of others.</h4> </li>
        
</ul>
<p>The following skills are associated with EI and can be practiced and improved on: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Self-awareness <br> <h4>the ability to recognize and understand your own emotions and being aware of the effect of your actions, moods, and emotions on other people.</h4></li> <br>

  <li>Self-regulation <br> <h4>expressing your emotions appropriately.</h4></li><br>
  <li>Social skills<br> <h4>build meaningful relationships with other people and develop a stronger understanding of themselves and others.</h4></li><br>
  <li>Empathy <br> <h4>ability to understand how others are feeling and your responses to people based on this information.</h4></li><br>
  <li>Intrinsic motivation <br> <h4>motivated by things beyond external rewards like fame, money, recognition, and acclaim.</h4></li>
</ul> </div> 
<h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2> <div class="glassbg">
<p>IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognize emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your decisions.
  IQ is relatively fixed and can not be changed, whereas EQ is a learned and improved ability. 
  </p> </div>
<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
<div class="glassbg"> <p>The value of EI is immense; developing emotional intelligence encourages many positive traits, from resilience to communication, motivation to stress management, all of which can be seen as conducive to effectively achieving personal, physical and occupational health, and success.</p> </div>
